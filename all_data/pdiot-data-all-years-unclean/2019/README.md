# PDIoT 2019 Data Collection

Welcome to PDIoT 2019! Please follow the instructions in this document to ensure that all data is collected in a similar way. 
This way, you can share the data with the rest of your coursemates. 

## Positioning
Regardless of the type of data you are collecting, make sure that the Nordic Cube is always placed with the round hole facing upwards.

For example:

Foot placement:

## Collecting
Connect the Nordic Cube to the provided [Android App](https://github.com/specknet/orient-android). Mark the appropriate fields on the app interface and begin the collection. Your files should be saved locally on the Android phone in the csv format. 

## Uploading data
Name the files in the following format:

*group_X-person_Y-position_Z-other_characters*

This will help you find data files easier.

Good luck!
